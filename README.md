# CODTECH Internship Task 1: File Integrity Checker

**Intern Name:** Kunal Girish Salunke  
**Intern ID:** CTIS5722  
**Domain:** Cyber Security & Ethical Hacking  
**Duration:** 4 Weeks  
**Mentor:** Muzammil

## Overview
This tool monitors file changes by calculating SHA-256 hashes and comparing them. It's built in Python using hashlib, os, and sys libraries.

## How to Run
- Generate baseline: `python file_integrity_checker.py generate files_to_check`
- Check integrity: `python file_integrity_checker.py check files_to_check`

## Files in This Repo
- file_integrity_checker.py: The main Python script.
- baseline.txt: Sample baseline hashes (generated by the tool).
- files_to_check/: Folder with test files (test1.txt, test2.txt).

## Explanation (Less than 500 words)
File integrity is all about keeping your files safe from unwanted changes, whether it's from hackers sneaking in malware or just some glitch during a file transfer. Imagine you've got important documents or code – if someone messes with them, it could spell trouble, like stolen data or broken software. In cyber security, checking file integrity helps spot these issues early, so you can fix things before they escalate. It's super relevant in ethical hacking, where you need to know if systems have been tampered with.
Hashes are the go-to way to do this because they're like a file's personal ID card. You run the file through an algorithm, and it gives you a unique string – change anything in the file, and that string totally flips. I like how the "avalanche effect" works; even a small tweak creates a whole new hash. From what I've seen on YouTube, like in that "Python Hashlib Tutorial" video by a guy explaining basics, hashes are secure because you can't work backwards from them to the original content. We picked SHA-256 for this tool since it's tough against attacks and standard in the industry. It's way better than old-school methods like checking file sizes, which miss sneaky edits.
This lines up perfectly with the CODTECH Task 1 poster: build a tool that monitors file changes by calculating and comparing hashes, using Python and stuff like hashlib to ensure integrity. I used online resources as they suggested – Googled some tutorials and watched a couple of videos on file monitoring projects, which helped me figure out handling big files without crashing the system.
Here's how the code ticks, step by step. We start with imports: hashlib for the hashing, os to poke around directories, sys for command inputs. The compute_hash function grabs a file, sets up SHA-256, and reads it in chunks – 4096 bytes at a time – to update the hash without hogging memory. It spits out a hex string or errors out if something's wrong.
For baseline generation, it scans the folder with os.walk, hashes each file, stores them in a dict, and writes to baseline.txt like "path:hash". Run it with "generate [folder]" and you're set.
Checking is the cool part: load the baseline, rescan and rehash, then compare. Missing file? "MISSING." Hash mismatch? "CHANGED." All good? "OK." It even flags new files. The main section handles your commands neatly.
In real life, this could watch server files or verify downloads. Those YouTube demos showed adding alerts, which would be neat. Overall, it's a solid intro to crypto in Python, and CODTECH's tips on resources made it doable.
